# products_by_category-widget
This is a set of scripts that can be used to create a widget element in WordPress to show products by their category in Elementor.
There is a plugin that I used called Unlimited Elements for Elementor where you can create your own widgets. It's pretty cool because it allows you to add html, css, and js all in the same editor.
As well you need to add attributes in order to do any custom editing in the editor panel of Elementor. The category accepted is the category_id number not the actual name of the slug. For instance if your category_id number for say 'bear_masks' is 26 you'd input 26 in the text field.
From there, if you've made your own custom widgets field you can simply drag and drop your custom widget.
